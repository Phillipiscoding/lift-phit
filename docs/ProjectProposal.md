# Fitness App | LiftPhit

## Application Definition Statement

LiftPhit serves as a reliable guide for novice powerlifters, providing them with a structured routine that effectively manages progressive overload in each workout. Old school bodybuilders and powerlifters have always used a notepad to track their workouts. These days we have notepads in our devices. While our modern notepads on our devices do not have the same issues of getting soggy from sweat as the notepads of the past did, they aren't without issues. They can become very messy and hard to organize. To solve this issue we need an app like LiftPhit, to help us keep track of our workout routines in an organized fashion.
