## Key Concepts - Handling Errors

**Error Codes/Status Codes**: APIs typically use standardized HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of a request. These status codes provide information about the success or failure of the request. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error). Understanding and interpreting these codes is essential for error handling.

* [HTTP Status Codes](https://www.webfx.com/web-development/glossary/http-status-codes/)
* [MDN Web Docs on HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)



**Error Responses**: When an error occurs, APIs often respond with error messages or error objects in the response body. These messages provide additional details about the error and can help in troubleshooting or informing the client about the issue. The response format can vary based on the API, such as JSON, XML, or plain text.

* [REST API response codes and error messages](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/odm/8.8.0?topic=api-rest-response-codes-error-messages)


**Error Handling Mechanisms**: APIs should provide clear and consistent error handling mechanisms to facilitate communication between the client and server. This may involve using specific HTTP headers, error response formats, or error code conventions. Well-documented APIs typically specify the expected error formats and how to handle them.

* [Error Handling](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16626/error-handling#:~:text=Error%20handling%20helps%20in%20handling,tools%20to%20handle%20the%20errors.)
* [Google Cloud API Design Guide on Error Handling](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors)


**Error Logging and Monitoring**: Logging errors that occur within your API is crucial for troubleshooting and maintaining the overall system health. By implementing error logging and monitoring, you can track and analyze errors, identify patterns, and proactively resolve issues to improve the API's reliability.

* [How to Log API Errors on Your Server](https://nordicapis.com/how-to-log-api-errors-on-your-server/)


**Graceful Error Handling**: When encountering an error, APIs should strive to provide meaningful and informative error messages to the client. This helps developers understand the issue and take appropriate actions. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages to maintain security.

* [JavaScript Weekly: Graceful Error Handling](https://medium.com/launch-school/javascript-weekly-graceful-error-handling-2f4045262df)
* [Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully)


**Rate Limiting and Throttling**: To protect your API from abuse or excessive usage, implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms is essential. These techniques restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given time period, preventing potential issues like Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and ensuring fair usage for all clients.

* [Rate Limiting and Throttling for RESTful API Security](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-rate-limit-throttle-restful-api-requests)



**Exception Handling**: In your API's backend code, proper exception handling should be implemented. This involves catching and appropriately handling exceptions or errors that occur during the processing of requests. Exception handling helps prevent unexpected crashes and provides the opportunity to return appropriate error responses.

* [Handling Exceptions Returned from the Web API](https://www.codemag.com/article/1603031/Handling-Exceptions-Returned-from-the-Web-API)


**Documentation and Error Reference**: Well-documented APIs provide clear guidance on how to handle errors. It's important to document the possible error codes, their meanings, and any additional information that can assist developers in troubleshooting. A comprehensive error reference allows clients to handle errors effectively and reduces support requests.
