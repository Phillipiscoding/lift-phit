# Wireframing

Wireframing is all about getting the ideas of your application out on the screen to really understand what you are going to be building and how to build it.

It can be simple sketches on paper or more formatted in a design tool such as XD. The goal here is to walk a user through the process of your application.


## Steps to wireframing

1. **Sketch key features:** In a project proposal, key features are planned for an application. A wireframe or sketch of those features begins to clarify and visually demonstrate the idea.
2. **Sketch creation features:** After key features are defined, we need to make sure the data presented on those pages have a place to be created. The creation process could be a part of the key features but likely the feature demonstrates some interaction with data rather than how the creation of data occurs.
3. **Sketch key static pages:** We also don't want to forget about the secondary more static pages that are found on sites, for example â€” home page, about page, contact form, 404 pages, etc.
4. **More Detail:** While a wireframe should never be too detailed, it is smart to detail out any parts of an application that are particularly tricky
