### Phillip Harden / Student ID: 0004964305

Hello there! I'm Phillip, a resident of Atlanta, GA, and I'm currently studying web development. During my free time, I like to indulge in sci-fi films and comedies. When it comes to music, I have a deep appreciation for all genres and I'm more than willing to invest in a Spotify or Apple Music account for the rest of my life. My family, which includes my lovely 4-year-old daughter and my spouse, serves as a great inspiration for me to pursue a career in web development.


My journey with coding began when I started tinkering with MySpace. I used to copy and paste code from websites to customize my profile, and that's when I was first exposed to coding. Learning HTML and CSS syntax came naturally to me, and I enjoyed styling my profile to my own liking. Despite not having any formal training, I've always enjoyed creating things on computers. I'm also excited to delve into the world of graphic art and design, as I'm eager to expand my skill set even further.
